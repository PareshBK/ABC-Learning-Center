<br/><br/>Collection and Use of Information<br/>

ABC will collect your personal information only if you provide it of your own volition. If you do not want your personal information to be collected, please do not submit it.<br/>

We value your privacy. We do not rent or sell your personal information. When you submit your personal details and contact information, you give us explicit consent to call, email, or send SMS to you to confirm participation at the event, workshop and/or to related courses/programmes you are registering to or registered in.<br/>
 <br/>

At any time, while accessing our site, you may decline participation in any activity that asks for information (i.e. survey email, or e-commerce). Your choice not to participate will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature on our website. You may opt-out of our mailing list at any time by sending an email to info@ABC.com. When you decide to opt-out, we will delete all information about you from our database.<br/>

<br/>Security<br/>

ABC has implemented several security features throughout the ABC site to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personal information. For instance, database information is kept separate from live servers and is firewall protected.<br/>

However, even though ABC endeavours to create a secure and reliable site for you, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from ABC via the ABC website or e-mail cannot be guaranteed. When disclosing any personal information, you should be mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to the public, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. ABC has no responsibility or liability for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.<br/>
